# DATA ANALYSIS OF HOMICIDE REPORTS 1980-2014

On this project I am doing Qualitative Research where I used Python Libraries to uncover trends and dive deeper into the problem (homicide).
I used the data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports) - a platform for data science competitions.

## Kaggle Notebook
I have made a notebook on Kaggle which you can take a look [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ninariccimarie/homicide-reports-1980-2014-analysis)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Software, Language and Libraries used
* Python 3.6.0
* Anaconda
* Spyder 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

### Things I have learned
Since the data is around 100mb and filled with 600,000 rows of data, it was hard at first to notice outliers. I am really glad
I found this course on Datacamp where they teach you on how to clean your data, it taught me to use different methods and some pointers
that could've been a problem if I wasn't careful. For example, to check whether all indeces are unique before dropping any rows 
using indices. Also that you could find outliers using data visualization.
I have also learned a lot with regards to statistics even though I didn't apply it here since most of my variables were categorical.

## Acknowledgments

I couldn't have finished this without the help from the Data Science community at Stackoverflow, Datacamp for walking me through
on how to clean my data, Kaggle, for letting us aspiring Data Scientists to learn from the experts all over the world, the 
person who uploaded the data set, and to everyone who motivated me to finish this, especially Patrick.

Thank you.
